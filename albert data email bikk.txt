resononing to start the job at 5 am
daily updates?
every minutes adhoc gets updated

start at sunday night or during the day


sundday - thursday proposal (at any time) so the data is ready at 5 am 
when do you expect the output when is the dead line for you at what time 5 am? 10 am?
and daily

sftp get statisics?

how long to go for (1 week?)



mon-friday
if run at 5 am potentially in 2 hrs vs like 4 during day
it indirectly hits the prod databases (alias tables) way it it designed
can't run sunday because issuances have happened over weekend (special processings, stipends, not regular payments.. accenture)
4 files total 3 dmps (dmp1 dmp2 dmp3), 1 count report html (tables)
we have to sftp the 4 files zipped/password (jerry fong) by 8 am ready and zipped/password
	(has a scripted job (bill) to have the files to used by his team)
	latest 9 am or have ready by 8 am
